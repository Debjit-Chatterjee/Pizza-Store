## D's Pizza Store
D's Pizza Store is a Pizza Delivery System Prototype developed with the intention to understand the principles of HTML, CSS, and JS specifically.
No backend mechanism have been implemented in this project. The authentication is simple JS validation.
A user is allowed to login and signup and browse through the orders and order anything in the checkout page.

**Note:** The intention behind this project is just to build a prototype website to demostrate the HTML, CSS and JS mechanisms.

Feel free to wander around. :grin: .
